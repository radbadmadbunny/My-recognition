!THIS IS A ROUGH DRAFT, THINGS CAN AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THIS MIGHT ALSO BE VERY BAD!

This code is meant to check with detectnet to see that you're wearing clothes.
It will check to see if you wear a shirt, socks, pants, shorts, and more.
This is meaningful because whenever you leave you can check to make sure you're wearing your pants.
